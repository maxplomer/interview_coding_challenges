/* Client Management */

If its physically possible to get data out of the Customertron, I will get that data out of the Customertron.  If necessary travel to Tron headquarters.

Or more realistically I would rather just the Client send me the data in whatever form they can, and most likely there is some common app to decode it like maybe "Sequel Pro" or a different database management tool.



/* Random Question #1 - Favorite Food */

Favorite food is whatever restaurant is close by and good.



/* Random Question #2 - Improvements to this webpage */


Still todo:

- Better picture/icon hosting, currently just using imgur for demo purposes

- Research better way to get topic instead using an if statement inside a for loop

- Thinner text for WOW in main logo

- Ask button needs to go to search page or open input for search

- Make main section more response to width change between 1200px and 768px, instead of fixing to 1200px above 768px
  
- Add dropdown for header nav buttons and :hover color change

- For Email Us page, testing more of effect to disable email input on system



Overall Design:

- For a university admissions/ask section, possibly not worry about mobile responsiveness and just have a fixed width of 1000px.

- Another option might be to integrate some sharp/flat design principals to build more of a university look/brand.

- Also a full size background picture taken at the university with a neat way to view it in a modal, possibly using FancyBox (fancybox.net) if needed.
