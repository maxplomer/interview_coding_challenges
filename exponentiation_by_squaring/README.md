#Exponentiation By Squaring

Exponentiating by squaring a method for fast computation of positive integer powers of a number. In comparing the [simple exponentiation](exp.rb) , the [recursive](exp_recursive.rb) and [while loop](exp_whileloop.rb) versions of exponentiation by square I received the following computation times for exp(2, 99999)


It is based on the following equations
